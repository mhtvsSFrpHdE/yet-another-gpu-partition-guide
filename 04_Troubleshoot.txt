## Emergency recovery

# The GPU Partition may fail due to reasons
# If you sure you can't boot to desktop because of GPU Partition
# There is two method to recovery from chaos so you can re configure it

# Remove virtual GPU adapter
# Shutdown first, then remove and try to boot
$vmName = "GuestVmWithGpu"
Remove-VMGpuPartitionAdapter -VMName $vmName

# Safe mode
# If simply remove virtual GPU adapter doesn't work
# You can use virtual machine reset button serval times on boot phase when you see Windows icon
# Until "Preparing Automatic Repair" shows, and "Startup Settings", "Enable Safe Mode" in these menu

# Check if there is any driver installed in guest
$drivers = Get-WindowsDriver -Online -All
$targetDriver = $drivers | Where-Object { $_.ClassName -EQ "Display" -and $_.ProviderName -Like "NVIDIA" }
$targetDriver

# If there is nothing, you may install it again since it doesn't survived after large Windows update
$driverExportDir = "C:\GpuDriver"
pnputil /add-driver "$driverExportDir\*.inf" /install

# If you plan to remove it
pnputil /delete-driver oemXX.inf
# Or with /force if something happened
pnputil /delete-driver oemXX.inf /force

## Graphics corroupted after Windows update

# 06-2025 KB5063060
# This update broke basic mode at all, no fix for that unless uninstall KB5063060
# Remote desktop (RDP) and enhanced session mode somehow still works but need extra tweaks
# On gpu crash, host event viewer system will have "nvlddmkm 153" entry logged

# First, disable any "Auto login" if you use "Autologon - Sysinternals" or "netplwiz", "registry hack"
# This is to prevent guest login itself in basic mode directly

# Now if you using local account and don't have password
# Add a password otherwise enhanced session mode won't work
# Remove virtual GPU and boot in basic mode
# Send Ctrl+Alt+Delete from menu and change password, you can use `1` for nothing

# Once you have password, add virtual gpu back
# Now use RDP or enhanced session, you can connect to guest OS and continue use GPU 

# If you insist on basic mode and can't uninstall KB5063060 directly for any reason
# Grab a early published Windows 11 24H2 disk ISO
# Use it to "upgrade" current system and keep all data
# After "upgrade", your OS patch level will back to early stage of 24H2
# You may google exclude certain Windows update and install rest, or doesn't install update at all

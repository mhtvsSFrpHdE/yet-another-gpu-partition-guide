Seems battleye will complain about CPU usage too high (98% or above on loading screen)

If kicked by battleye when try to join online, allocate more CPU core / thread.  
For example, AMD 8400F has total 6 core 12 thread on host
- If I only allocate 6 core (6 core 6 thread) to virtual machine, will be kicked by battleye
- If I allocate 8 core (4 core 8 thread), battleye allow me to play online
